      <title>Redesigning Olbrich Gardens</title>

      <description>Full final deck presentation available here
For my branding / visual design project, my design brief was to tackle the Olbrich Botanical Garden in Madison, WI as a rebranding project. For context, I had done some branding / logo work in the past, but never at a more specific level as this project. The work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the past had always had branding as a side to a full web redesign and development, so this project was super exciting to tackle considering that I would need to shelf some preconceptions in my design process in order to streamline this one.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on branding experience for nonprofits</title>
      <link>https://proxycase.github.io/posts/thoughts_on_branding_experience_for_nonprofits/</link>

      <guid>https://proxycase.github.io/posts/thoughts_on_branding_experience_for_nonprofits/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the ways in which branding is used not just by designers, but also by people using the most available tools. Non-profits and non-tech companies are often the quickest to use branding incorrectly, either because there is no dedicated designer, lack of training, and a plethora of other reasons. Having worked for several non-profits, I know that time is precious, and so is budget – so getting results quickly with the least amount of effort is paramount to a small (often overworked) staff.</description>

      <description>This week, I paired with Kevin to learn how React was being used to build the front-end for one of 8th Light&amp;rsquo;s clients. After learning how this project was structured, from using React with Typescript, he gave me this little component to try out and build from an empty React environment.
After going through the basic React tutorial, I had some understanding of how components are structured, pass values to each other, and how to create stateless functions and classes.</description>

      <title>Design system differences between iOS and Android</title>

      <description>There&#39;s a lot of nuance in so many different areas considering the differences between both of these systems, so in this post, I will focus on just a couple of differences between the two design systems, rather than trying to accomplish a holistic coverage differentiating the two.
Themes &amp;amp; Principles There are a good number of similarities and a few key distinguishing elements between iOS and Android platforms. The similarities come from iterations over graphic and interaction design patterns as the web app and native app ecosystems mature.</description>

      <title>Intro to CSS Animations</title>

      <description>Animation is all about the control of objects over time. In this post, we&#39;ll explore control over shapes and timeline with using css. If there&#39;s enough time, we&#39;ll also look at some Javascript libraries and how that can help us make more complex visualizations, as well as introduce some interactivity.
 Quick note on transitions To make something animate from one state to the next, you might not need something particularly fancy.</description>

      <title>Sassy refactor: making reusable sass components</title>

      <description>In the previous post, I looked at semantic names and roles of HTML elements, and creating better naming conventions to better visualize the relationship of css classes to their HTML elements using BEM. Now, I dive into refactoring the CSS/Sass world, in order to create better structure and maintainability.
This week, I dove into refactoring different elements of my doggy daycare example project website. For this, I look closer at how to organize my stylistic choices, separate them from layouts, typography, tokens, and look at how sass deals with mixins, placeholder selectors, and more advanced sass concepts.</description>

      <description>The Block For a moment, we&#39;ll be looking at the following example pulled from one of my recent projects.

Thinking out loud This is a &amp;lt;section&amp;gt; on my homepage, describing features in a 3 column setup. This could be either a grid/flexbox situation, where each flow directly on top of each other at a certain media size, or instead of taking too much vertical space, fold into a carousel – but carousels aren&#39;t great for accessibility or conversion.</description>

      <description>The BEM naming convention methodology is designed to reduce complexity, increase legibility, and discoverability. By looking at a CSS class written in BEM, you should get a sense of:
 Knowing what that selector might do To have an idea of where it might be used Knowing the relationship between the class names   “CSS is not a pretty language. While it is simple to learn and get started with, it soon becomes problematic at any reasonable scale.</description>

      <title>Semantic Html</title>

      <guid>https://proxycase.github.io/posts/semantic-html/</guid>
      <description>Why write semantic HTML? There is a lot of confusing code out there in the world today. It’s not limited to HTML or CSS, but perhaps because these “languages” are so prolific, somewhat easy to learn, and because everyone has their own “style,”
I know that at least for me there wasn’t a lot of incentive to think too hard about doing everything properly as long as it worked.
When I first started writing html websites, I used generic divs for everything, and divs to hold those divs, and relied on classes for pretty much any sort of styling.</description>

      <description>Part two of two on &amp;quot;all&amp;quot; of the html elements (that are not obsolete).
Images &amp;amp; Multimedia          &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; Used to embed images. Replaces the ancient &amp;lt;image&amp;gt; element. &amp;lt;img&amp;gt; so 2008, you so two-thousand-and-LATE.             &amp;lt;map&amp;gt; Used to create an image map (which is an area that is clickable, and might have multiple clickable spots, like a map, or an image that has clickable areas).</description>

      <description>In the following articles, I attempt to re-configure and define all the html elements in my own words and also try to figure out where they belong in relationship to each other. Part one of two.
The Head          &amp;lt;html&amp;gt; Is the root level of an himl document. All other elements are children of this element.             &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; Container for machine-readable information like metadata.</description>

      <description>Tasks  Finalize competitive analysis synthesis Review survey data Review themes into insights Meet with “stakeholders” Begin wireframes for testing  Lots of discoveries Last night’s interview was really insightful because I was able to talk to someone who directly helps set up mobile applications for customers at a major bank. Her insights were really great, and while I did also ask her about her banking habits, there are a number of discoveries that she can identify as being problems:</description>

      <description>Tasks  Competitive Analysis synthesis Send out surveys Interviews Synthesize Interviews to Themes Start building deck  After sending out the survey last night, I got about 10 responses to a variety of questions about banking and budgeting. 100% of the responses were self-identified as Millenial, which makes sense but also the right audience for the project. I think what is most telling about the difference between my interviews and the survey-takers is that the interviewees tended to have entirely online banks, and the survey-takers had credit unions, and had also chosen banks based on their physical proximity to them.</description>

      <description>Both interviews this morning/afternoon went well, and represented quite different experiences of how banking plays a role in our lives. KD, who is part of the older Millenial demographic, sought the help of a financial advisor along with her husband, to figure out future savings and investment opportunities. LN, a younger Millenial, used only one bank, the USAA, made for families of veterans and enlisted individuals. Both experiences were primarily or only web-based, and relied on the mobile app to interface directly with the bank.</description>

      <description>Last week, I had a design presentation which laid out the steps I took to build a fictional doggy daycare, and designed a website to interface with that business. While the project was internal and an experiment to push my skills, branding wasn’t a central focus of the project and I was ultimately asked about my color choices. Typically, I’m used to being given colors from clients from preexisting guidelines, but in this case, I had pulled up a color-theme making website and choose something that I thought just felt right.</description>

      <description>Land Acknowledgement While I research, study, and practice my design craft, I embody a physical space that resides on the traditional homelands of the Three Fires Confederacy: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations. Many other tribes have called this area home, including the Miami, Ho-chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox. The site (Chicago, IL) where I work and live was a site of trade, gathering, and healing for more than a dozen other Native tribes, while the state of Illinois is currently home to more than 75,000 tribal members.</description>

      <description>In the previous post, I wrote about the first two stages in the design process: Discover and Define. I’ll be diving deeper into the second half of the process, where we take ideas that were distilled through the process, and are made into real designs, and real code.
Now that we’ve turned the Insights into “How might we’s,” there are a list of direct, actionable items to build out in our design program of choice.</description>

      <description>While there are a variety of approaches to the design process, the overall purpose of the system remains the same:
To distill information, and to use it to develop appropriate solutions to a user problems. Ideally, the design tackles problems specifically identified from user contexts. By studying users, we solve problems in a measureable, evidence-driven manner.
Why used a defined design process? Real problems arise when products and services are developed without proper design research.</description>

      <title>On designing my personal logo</title>
      <link>https://proxycase.github.io/posts/logo-design/</link>

      <guid>https://proxycase.github.io/posts/logo-design/</guid>
      <description>In order to consider what it is that makes a logo, I first thought about the purpose, or why a logo needs to exist. While I’ve made logo designs in the past, I had made them for the express purposes of putting it on a portfolio website. In those cases, the logo serves a purpose of helping my personal brand or identity more visible, more memorable, and hopefully give the viewers a sense of personality.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Hugh, and today marks my first day as a Design Apprentice at 8th Light. For the last several years, I worked as a makerspace coordinator at the Northbrook Public Library, and helped design and build the makerspace from the ground-up, creating access to tools like 3D printers and laser cutters to the public. I created policies that shaped our services and opened up access to those outside of our own library, knowing that Northbrook is a unique area with plenty of resources to share.</description>
