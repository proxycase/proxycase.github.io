			<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about the ways in which branding is used not just by designers, but also by people using the most available tools. Non-profits and non-tech companies are often the quickest to use branding incorrectly, either because there is no dedicated designer, lack of training, and a plethora of other reasons. Having worked for several non-profits, I know that time is precious, and so is budget – so getting results quickly with the least amount of effort is paramount to a small (often overworked) staff.</p>
<p>When a poster is needed to advertise an event or signage is needed, branding is often times ignored because of the availability of those tools to accommodate branding – for example, a company I worked for started to use a free, online-based design app that had built-in presets for design templates. While none of these templates followed the design branding put in place, these were easy choices for a company that didn&rsquo;t have enough resources to dedicate to design, and wanted to have the largest amount of impact as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>So that all being said, there are a couple of things that I can provide as guidance for these organizations when developing a brand.</p>
<p>These are things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing clear documentation on use of brand, logo, signage, etc.</li>
<li>Providing a series of quickly importable logos and other necessary files.</li>
<li>Creating a set of templates that can accommodate a wide range of uses. Put these in the design programs that staff like to use, and can use with relative ease.</li>
<li>Getting proper buy-in from all of the stakeholders, and staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the last point: while it can be near impossible to get everyone to love the design, it can be enough to help them understand the value that cohesive brand usage can do to an organization. I think most people understand the value of a brand, given their ubiquity in our lives. But non-profits can sometimes suffer from their own version of an impostor syndrome, when thinking about branding as an organization. When (insert: overworked, underpaid, etc) staff members don&rsquo;t completely align with the mission or values of the administrative staff, that can create a friction that&rsquo;s hard to shake.</p>
<p>While this kind of challenge falls beyond the branding effort, it only exemplifies the need for an organization to help everyone feel welcome, and proud to wear their branded outfits, and feel good that their efforts are worth it. Branding can help, but it&rsquo;s only one step in a larger effort to bring cohesiveness to an org.</p>
