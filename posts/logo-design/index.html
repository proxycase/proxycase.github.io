<p>In order to consider what it is that makes a logo, I first thought about the purpose, or why a logo needs to exist. While I’ve made logo designs in the past, I had made them for the express purposes of putting it on a portfolio website.  In those cases, the logo serves a purpose of helping my personal brand or identity more visible, more memorable, and hopefully give the viewers a sense of personality. In this particular process, the goal is the same, but to update and elevate the personal brand using some updated skills, incorporate new visual knowledge, and apply an updated style.</p>

<h3 id="some-preliminary-concerns">Some Preliminary Concerns</h3>

<p>• I’d like to avoid using my name as the logo. While it’s the simplest solution as I can find or create a font that appropriately fits the characteristics that I’m looking for, I think a non-text logo will be more memorable, and apply more personality. Plus, I’m looking to do something different than what I have in the past.
• When some letters become too abstract, they may be read as other characters. It’s best to find a balance between abstract/creative expression and readability, because unreadable text can make people feel frustrated.
• Minimalism is great but can lead to boring results. Color can help, but logos also have to look nice in B&amp;W, so the form should be interesting no matter what the context.</p>

<h3 id="defining-a-process">Defining a process</h3>

<p>I think every time I’ve sat down to think about a personal brand logo, I’ve generally started because I was inspired by some shape, color, or form and wanted to adapt it as a form of identity. Generally speaking, logos tend to either stand at the forefront, or allow themselves to fit neatly within the design space, almost to disappear so that the other content (say, portfolio) comes to the front.</p>

<p>To begin, I started to sketch out some basic forms and ideas that I liked from various sources of inspiration. But I’m going to take a moment now to step back, and identify some words and concepts that I want to consider working into or imply through the design. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>A sense of kindness, consideration, friendliness</li>
<li>Modern, minimalist, but with character</li>
<li>Dualism of mature and child-like qualities</li>
<li>A sense of my roots, Japanese influences?</li>
</ul>

<p>Thinking through this, I’m starting to wonder if the logo actually avoids being text, but rather a mark, like my family crest, the agehachō.</p>

<h3 id="agehacho">Agehacho</h3>

<p>Supposedly, my father is supposed to pass his family crest down to me, but he actually rejects his lineage and so he’s either too stubborn to tell me or he just doesn’t know it. However, I do know the crest on my mother’s side – the Agehachō, which is the Swallowtail Butterfly.</p>

<p><img src="/agehacho.jpg" alt="Image" /></p>

<p>It’s a beautiful crest, belonging to the Taira clan, which is supposedly down my mother’s line (this side is passed through the female lineage only). But technically, any generation can choose their <em>mon</em>, or “crest.”</p>

<p>I’m not trying to make a whole new family crest right now but it’s a great place to start, and who knows, by the end of this, I might adapt it for that purpose. What is really nice about these family crests is that they are super old, but they’re rather timeless at the same time. They’re made to be in black and white, and feature a lot of minimal, bold concepts that work really well for logotypes.</p>

<h2 id="drafting-it-out">Drafting it out</h2>

<p>I found this brand drafting deck in the office, which helped immensely in identifying adjectives to consider important characteristics when building the logo. It helped me identify concepts which I would like to and would not like to associate with the identity.</p>

<p>The six final words chosen were:
• Approachable
• Crafted
• Disciplined
• Experimental / Agile
• Sincere / Humble</p>

<h2 id="landing-on-a-solution">Landing on a solution</h2>

<p>I asked Gina, another designer if she’d take a look at where I was so far, and I talked through my process a bit, and where I was headed. She noted that the concept connecting to this deeper Japanese tradition element was interesting, although I had been struggling with figuring out whether that was really where I was going to end up. But that advice ended up being really helpful because after another round of visual research, I landed on some awesome Japanese textile patterns, and had been looking for something organic, alive, and symbolic to my culture. Alas, it was the humble dragonfly!</p>

<p>Up to that point, I had been toying around with some organic circles, that remind me of some graphical rocks that I once saw in some Scandinavian design at some point. I’ve always identified with and admired design from that colder region of the world for their sense of contemplative, bold but quaint characteristics. Combining that with the dragonfly textile imagery really hit the spot for me.</p>

<p><img src="/img/h-logo-01.jpg" alt="Logo Iteration 1" /></p>

<p>From there, I thought about spicing up the text a little. I started on Futura, a font that I know carries a lot of design baggage, which could work, but in its current iteration, I’m working with serif fonts to help it push away from the child-like imagery just enough to make it distinguished, crafted, and disciplined. I added some spacing in the eyes and wings to help it read from a distance, and arrived at the following.</p>

<p><img src="/img/h-logo-03.jpg" alt="Logo Iteration Final" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s two options, based on the context. The black and white one is for print and physical designs, while the color can live anywhere on the internet.</p>

<p>I think it’s simple, memorable, and stands out. At the risk of looking a bit like a children’s toy company, I think it displays a sense of hand-made, balanced, and approachable feelings. Hopefully, the text allows it to appear more distinguished and disciplined, complementing the logo in its playfulness. The dragonfly is both a humble creature, and natural being. It’s a symbol of agility and bravery in Japanese culture, and acts as a source of inspiration for me and my practices.</p>

<p>Who knows, this might all change very soon but we&rsquo;ll see!</p>
