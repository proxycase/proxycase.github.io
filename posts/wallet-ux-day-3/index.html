<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finalize competitive analysis synthesis</li>
<li>Review survey data</li>
<li>Review themes into insights</li>
<li>Meet with “stakeholders”</li>
<li>Begin wireframes for testing</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="lots-of-discoveries">Lots of discoveries</h2>

<p>Last night’s interview was really insightful because I was able to talk to someone who directly helps set up mobile applications for customers at a major bank. Her insights were really great, and while I did also ask her about her banking habits, there are a number of discoveries that she can identify as being problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Huge confusion on the difference between available balance and current balance</li>
<li>People never remember their passwords – use of faceID and fingerprint is high</li>
<li>There’s an in-app authenticator, which generates a number to help authenticate users over the phone.</li>
<li>Mint gets things in the wrong categories all the time.</li>
<li>Really hard to find out where to order a replacement debit card in app.</li>
<li>She recommends users use both in-app credit/fico score report as well as Credit Karma score, because of the difference in which they calculate those scores.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="on-presenting-findings">On presenting findings</h2>

<p>Spent the majority of today trying to synthesize the mountain of information I’ve gotten from this research into one, legible slideshow. What’s challenging is that there are a number of different fronts to tackle this problem from. There are the basic banking elements, which in this context, the challenge is how to place a “Wallet Account” into the financial ecosystem of our users.</p>

<p>For example, some interviewees mentioned having more than one account at different banks in order to take advantage of certain features, like higher APR, or cash-back / points rewards on credit cards. The real benefit of budgeting apps is the idea that they can bring all of those accounts together into one centralized system – Simple doesn’t do that. Instead, Simple only accounts for payments done on that singular account. Empower Bank does bring in other accounts to its system, but its tradeoff is that it’s almost too simple and users are frustrated that there’s no phone number to contact them – only a in-app messaging system, and an email.</p>

<p>I ended up focusing a larger chunk of my competitive analysis on Empower because I saw them as a primary competitor. They already offer some nice budgeting software built-in, and you’re able to consolidate budget views from external accounts. That being said, their support system sucks, and they also don’t have a desktop/web platform, nor do they have photo check deposits, which is a fairly standard feature – considering you need a way to add money to the account, typically, before direct deposit kicks in, if your users even have that as an option.</p>

<p>Other, additional services that users seem to like and look for in finance applications are elements like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Easy transfers of money, like Zelle or Venmo</li>
<li>Some philanthropic effort, or at least some social good that the bank provides – some of my surveys noted using credit unions for that reason.</li>
<li>Round-up automated savings (eg. Saves $0.48 cents for a $12.52 purchase)</li>
<li>Additional accounts (like partner accounts) - an interviewee noted wanting to have cards with different appearances so she can differentiate between them too.</li>
</ul>
