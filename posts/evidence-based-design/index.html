			<p>Last week, I had a design presentation which laid out the steps I took to build a fictional doggy daycare, and designed a website to interface with that business. While the project was internal and an experiment to push my skills, branding wasn’t a central focus of the project and I was ultimately asked about my color choices. Typically, I’m used to being given colors from clients from preexisting guidelines, but in this case, I had pulled up a color-theme making website and choose something that I thought just <em>felt right.</em></p>
<p>Of course, defending that decision is a whole ‘nother story. After the meeting, I immediately launched into some research about defending design decisions that are abstract, and unscientifically defined (like many things in visual design). Thankfully, there <em>are</em> a good number of things in design that can be defended through scientific evidence, or through ethnographic observations and interviews, such as best standards for forms, or how buttons should look like buttons, and where navigational controls should exist on a website and app.</p>
<h2 id="giving-shape-to-creativity">Giving shape to creativity</h2>
<p>Evidence-based design helps give form to an otherwise abstract decision-making process. We designers often come to the table with preexisting knowledge about how other products they’ve designed have and have not worked. We also have our own biases about descriptive verbiage that clients say they want their <em>thing</em> to look like. These are terms like “elevated style,” “business oriented,” “sleek,” etc. The idea of proper UX research is that we can point directly at our users and say, <em>“these people want this, and that’s why we made these decisions.”</em></p>
<h2 id="borrowing-concepts-from-other-fields">Borrowing concepts from other fields</h2>
<p>Ethnography is a common word you hear in UX research, because it’s not all that far from the study of cultural anthropology, where that word comes from. I view UX research as a form of applied cultural anthropology, which begins with the understanding that the users of the products we design for, are not us. In fact, we must start from the knowledge and assumption that people who you are making these products for (even if you fall into the target demographic) have great variances in their experience of the observable universe, and therefore it is our job to embed ourselves, scrutinize, interview, poke and prod at <em>that world</em> to understand where our differences are.</p>
<p>This ties directly into the idea of <em>cultural relativism,</em> where humans are studied in relation to their own subculture, instead of a dominant cultural definition. For example, just because someone lives in the US, it does not mean they subscribe or live with the prescript of an “American way” or value concepts such as “freedom” and “pursuit of happiness.” That much should be obvious to anyone given our current political situation, and it ties into the way our designed cultural objects (products) are perceived, and accepted into a persons life.</p>
<h3 id="civilization-is-not-something-absolute-but--is-relative-and--our-ideas-and-conceptions-are-true-only-so-far-as-our-civilization-goes-franz-boas">“Civilization is not something absolute, but … is relative, and … our ideas and conceptions are true only so far as our civilization goes.” Franz Boas</h3>
<h2 id="working-with-clients">Working with Clients</h2>
<p>As scientific and wonderful this field is in its nuances, at the end of the day, we have to defend our designs to our clients. As designer, we are poised to act as both advocate for our client, and the audience they serve. A product cannot exist only to extract value and wealth from its users (as Facebook has learned and is learning all the time via lawsuits), and typically, a product cannot exist without the support of users and the fulfilment of a cultural desire (think Tinder).</p>
<p>When shaping arguments to defend color decisions or the position of some variable text, it’s most useful to clients to talk about the value it brings to them, and how it aligns with the value it brings to the users. Very rarely will the act of evidence-extracting detract from the product value to clients, though you may find that something that the client believed to be critical was actually harming users. In those cases, it’s important to consider ethical reasons and push for change, continue to question those decisions, or refuse to work on that project altogether. For the most part, however, evidence-based design will only help provide reason and consistency to the decision-making process.</p>
