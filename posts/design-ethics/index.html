<h2 id="land-acknowledgement">Land Acknowledgement</h2>

<p>While I research, study, and practice my design craft, I embody a physical space that resides on the traditional homelands of the Three Fires Confederacy: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi nations. Many other tribes have called this area home, including the Miami, Ho-chunk, Menominee, Sac and Fox. The site (Chicago, IL) where I work and live was a site of trade, gathering, and healing for more than a dozen other Native tribes, while the state of Illinois is currently home to more than 75,000 tribal members.

<h2 id="taking-up-physical-space">Taking up physical space</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it’s easy to forget that in our digital work, we take up physical space. I love UX design work for the reason that it is a constant reminding of product owners and developers that our work ends up in the physical spaces where our users are. Our work may be digital, but as long as we are creating accessible functions for people, the product will end up affecting physical bodies, existing in physical contexts.</p>

<p>I’ve worked in the dance field for 7 years till now, and the one concept that I’ve kept in mind is that our body knows more than we think. The interface to the brain is the body, and in order to design products that naturally embed themselves into peoples lives, designers must study the way in which people interact with the world. This being said, there are a great variety of people in the world, and on top of that, a great variety in contexts for which these people exist. Therein lies the great challenge of making something that people actually want, and something that they can actually use.</p>

<h3 id="we-are-unclear-how-ethics-should-affect-our-work-but-we-are-much-more-aware-of-the-negative-impact-of-being-unethical-in-tech-how-to-design-with-ethics-christian-beck-https-medium-com-ux-power-tools-how-to-design-with-ethics-dd0b6ec9c503">“[…] we are unclear how ethics should affect our work but we are much more aware of the negative impact of being unethical in tech.” <a href="https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/how-to-design-with-ethics-dd0b6ec9c503">How to Design With Ethics - Christian Beck</a></h3>

<h2 id="defining-strong-beliefs-loosely-held">Defining strong beliefs, loosely held</h2>

<p>The work begins by defining your ethical standards, and ideally, communicating them with others to see if your values are aligned with those around you, and then constantly challenging those beliefs. Having strong beliefs is important so that you can defend and explain ethical decisions when you make them, while allowing yourself to not get too tied to any idea without allowing space to be challenged by someone elses’ beliefs, and saving the possibility that you might still be wrong, and that you might not always have the right answer.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-apply-these-ethics">When to apply these ethics</h2>

<p>While the amount of work you have to do to enforce ethical decisions varies by client, all design work requires some amount of ethical check-in. Often, that takes the form of making defensive choices based on accessibility. When client suggestions, or preexisting design systems are not accessible, designers can present alternatives, show evidence (WAI-ARIA standards, AA color blindness measurements, etc) and show clients the value it actually brings to their business. At the end of the day, businesses just want to succeed and make money, so when explaining ethical decisions, it’s key to phrase it in ways that positively affect the business so they can achieve their business goals.</p>

<h2 id="play-design-games">Play (Design) Games</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.ethicsfordesigners.com/">Ethics for Designers</a> provides various games and worksheets to help designers identify ways in which a product might negatively affect end users, and how to avoid them. It’s nicely divided into three sections, from setting ethical terms at the start of the project, envisioning ethical outcomes, and communicating ethics to a client. Advocating for ethics can be challenging, regardless of what stage you’re coming into a design project, so their guidelines are super helpful.</p>

<h2 id="read-up">Read up</h2>

<p>It’s important to stay informed about different dark design patterns as they appear in the news, and continue to educate yourself about ways to anticipate, and to deal with problems when they arise. Often times, bad ethical decisions are made by ignorance and by accident. Pokemon Go probably didn’t anticipate or intend for people to trespass private properties when designing their system, but it did. Makers of automatic hand-soap dispensers didn’t mean for their product to be racist (by not recognizing dark skintones), but they did. Facebook didn’t intend to force a lesbian choir-singer to come out to her parents, <a href="https://vimeo.com/68470326">but it did</a>.</p>

<p>I think it’s more clear than ever with how many things in the world are designed for your attention, how things can go terribly wrong, even with the best intended products. Designers have the capability to potentially reach hundreds of millions of people with their work, and is a position of privilege. In order to avoid abusing that power, it’s important to anticipate (and I know, you can’t possibly anticipate everything) – to the best of your abilities with the resources you have – the potential ethical problems you may run into.</p>
